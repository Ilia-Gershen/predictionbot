# predictionbot
A Telegram bot was created to provide users with a prediction of the closing price for cryptocurrencies for the following week. In the bot, the user can choose the coin of interest and see up-to-date forecasting for this day and the following 6 days. Every day at around midnight the bot is updating the prediction based on the closing price for the current day. The predictions are made using the LSTM-GRU hybrid deep learning model.

You can try the bot by writing “Prediction Bot” in the Telegram search bar.
